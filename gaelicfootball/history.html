                                    <h3>A Brief Summary of The History of Gaelic football</h3>
                                </p>

								A rough form of Gaelic football was played commonly throughout the Middle Ages. Similar versions of this
								early form of Gaelic football spread across Europe and birthed the modern games of both soccer and rugby.
								There are few references to Gaelic football before the 1600s and the earliest record of the modern version
								of football was in Meath in 1670 where the actions of both kicking and catching the ball were permitted in the game.<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								Despite the banning in 1695 of Sunday football by the “Sunday Observance Act”, the 17th century provides us
								with several detailed accounts of football matches being played. A football match between teams from the river
								Boyne and the river Nanny was described in detail in the late 1600s. In the 1700s Dublin newspapers began to
								write reports of games in Finglas, Milltown, and Drumcondra.<br>
								<br>
								<br> <img src="../assets/images/observanceact.jpg" align="left" alt="Observance act laws" class="image4">
								Football began to spread rapidly for the first 40 years of the 19th century. In Kerry a game called “caid” was
								played, this is a cross country version of the game. Six-a-side versions of the game began being played in Dublin
								in the early 18th century. 100 years later there are reports of inter-county games being played.<br>
								<br>
								<br> 
								The potato famine of the 1840s had a detrimental effect on Gaelic football. A version of the game with set rules
								had emerged from east Munster but the arrival of soccer and rugby had taken the attention of the upper-class citizens.
								Native football was in danger of dying out. This threat was evident in schools across the country as soccer and 
								rugby quickly became the main sports. All over Ireland Gaelic football was prohibited by government officials, 
								priests, and landlords over fears the games were being used to host meetings for nationalist bodies.<br>
								<br>
								<br> <img src="../assets/images/hayes.jpg" align="left" alt="Hayes hotel" class="image5">
								Garrison games thrived in Ireland around this time while between the famine and the formation of the GAA, football
								was close to extinction. But our native games did not die. Limerick was a stronghold for all native games with 
								organized local competitions taking place with set rules. Football was in the worst shape of all these sports until
								the foundation of the GAA which has led to the promotion of the games.<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								In modern times, Gaelic games have formally existed since the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association in the
								billiards room of Hayes hotel, a Tipperary hotel in 1884. There, led by visionaries Michael Cusack and Maurice Davin,
								the first formalized codes and cohesive organisation of the ancient Irish games were initiated, and the seeds planted
								for what would become Ireland's largest sporting organisation.<br>
